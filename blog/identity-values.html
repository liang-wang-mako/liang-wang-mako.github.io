        <h2>
          <li>
            Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
            how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the
            decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          When I worked as a programmer and app developer, I was presented with
          several ethical decisions throughout my career. One of the most
          memorable examples of this was when I had to decide between releasing
          a new feature that could potentially compromise customer privacy but
          would improve the customer experience, versus waiting to release the
          feature until further privacy protection measures could be
          implemented.
        </p>
        <p>
          After debating the issue, I ultimately decided to set the feature
          release aside and put extra measures in place to ensure that customer
          privacy and confidentiality were not compromised. At the time, I felt
          that the preservation of customer data was the most important, and
          that short-term gains should not be prioritized at the cost of
          compromising long-term security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflecting on this decision now, I am confident in my choice and stand
          by it. I based my decision on the principles to not prioritize
          corporate needs over the safety of my customers and the importance of
          protecting their data. In this case, I was able to reconcile the
          conflicting obligations of customer experience with customer data
          security by deciding the latter to be of higher importance.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>
            Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
            your values and identity.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          My Chinese culture has had a huge influence on my values and identity.
          Growing up in China, I was exposed to traditional Chinese values such
          as respect for elders and a strong emphasis on family. I also learned
          to be resilient and to strive for excellence in whatever I do.
          Additionally, I saw a great emphasis on education and hard work, so
          even after I immigrated to New Zealand, these values remained with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the people around me have played an important role in
          building my identity and values. My friends and family back in China,
          as well as the people I have met in New Zealand, have all shaped my
          worldview. My various interactions with them have influenced my
          thoughts and helped me develop my understanding of the world. These
          experiences have enabled me to become more open-minded and to
          appreciate different perspectives.

            Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
            learning journey.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          My strengths include my attention to detail, my interest in accuracy, rationality, and logic, my willingness to explore new resources and technologies, my ability to connect with others and build relationships, and my open and curious attitude towards learning.</p> 
          <p>These strengths will help me make the most of my learning journey and will allow me to make meaningful connections with other learners while understanding challenges as they come. </p>
          <p>Additionally, my previous learning and working experience will be a huge asset in helping me learn new technologies and pushing my skills to the next level. </p>
          <p>Finally, being a friendly team player will go a long way in connecting with others, finding relevant resources, and helping me stay on top of my learning.</p>

        <h2>

            Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
            development. How might these affect your learning journey?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          My limitations may include a lack of experience or knowledge in certain technologies, an inability to stay focused on a task for a longer period of time. These limitations could affect my learning journey by causing frustrations when I try to do a challenge I'm not familar with, making it difficult to stay organized. However, these limitations can be addressed by developing good work habits, such as breaking tasks into smaller chunks to remain focused, taking regular through breaks. With regular practice and hard work, I can develop the necessary skills and expand your knowledge that, in turn, will improve your learning journey.

        <h2>
          <li>
            Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
            others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you
            tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on
            what other strategies you would try now and why.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was once working on a project where I needed to collaborate with different departments in order to finish it on time. Unfortunately, there was a sense of resistance and tension between the departments, making it difficult to efficiently move forward with the project. The strategies I tried at the time to address the issue were to organize team meetings, set achievable goals, and to encourage open and honest communication. These strategies were initially successful in negotiating an understanding between the teams, but because the underlying issues between them remained unresolved, I noticed that the cooperation started to deteriorate after a while. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If I had to do this again today, I would focus more on getting to the root cause of the tension and resistance by encouraging candid conversations between the teams. I would also try to foster a sense of collaboration by highlighting the mutual benefits of working together, and emphasizing the importance of open communication. By addressing the underlying issues and building a cohesive team atmosphere, I believe this could have led to long-term solutions that would have allowed us to work productively together.
