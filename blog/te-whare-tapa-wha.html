        <p>
          In this blog, I will create a holistic well-being plan based on the
          different aspects of Te Whare Tapa Whā.
        </p>
        <h2 class="justify"><li>What Is Te whare tapa whā</li></h2>
        <ul>
          Te whare tapa whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing
          developed by Sir Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective on
          health. The 4 dimensions are:
          <li>taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha hinengaro (mental wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li>
          <li>taha whānau (family wellbeing).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With 4 walls, the wharenui (meeting house) is a symbol of these 4
          dimensions. The wharenui's connection with the whenua (land) forms the
          foundation for the other 4 dimensions.
        </p>

          class="image-example"
          src="../image/maori-health.jpg"
          alt="Maori Health"
        />
        <h2 class="justify">
          <li>Whenua (connection with the land or environment)</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the land
          and the natural environment is strongly connected to our health and
          wellbeing. You can think about whenua as your place of belonging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Connection to the land and to nature has been shown to improve mental
          and physical wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan to connect the land and nature is spending 45 minutes outside
          walking every day to enjoy the beautiful environment and breath the
          fresh air, watering and maitaining my garden every week, and taking a
          short travelling every month.
        </p>
        <h2 class="justify"><li>Taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</li></h2>
        <p>
          Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your body
          grows, feels and moves, and how you care for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nourishing and strengthening your physical wellbeing helps you to cope
          with the ups and downs and life. Feeling physically well helps you
          feel mentally well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some key things to take care of taha tinana are physical activity,
          healthy eating, sleep and not smoking.
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan to support my physical well-being is eating fresh food and
          keeping balanced nutrition for my body, arranging proper sleeping
          time, and helping a friend of mine quit drinking.
        </p>
        <h2 class="justify">
          <li>Taha Hinengaro (emotional and mental wellbeing)</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings.
          It's about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking care of taha hinengaro is important for everyone, regardless of
          whether or not you've experienced mental illness or distress.
        </p>
        <p>
          When taha hinengaro is strong, you can better cope with life's
          challenges. You can express your feelings and reach out for support
          from friends, whānau and hoamahi (colleagues) if you need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan to keep strong Taha Hinengaro is to practice being mindful and
          neuroplasticity everyday, cultivating a growth mindset, avoiding
          stress by doing exercises and developing good relationships with
          people I work with.
        </p>

        <h2 class="justify"><li>Taha Wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</li></h2>
        <p>
          Your spiritual essence is your life force. This is who and what you
          are, where you have come from and where you are going.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is
          the capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief in a
          higher power. For others, wairua is an internal connection to the
          universe or the sacred. There is no right or wrong way to think of or
          experience wairua, but it is an important part of your mental
          wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual wellbeing can be expressed through beliefs, values,
          traditions and practices that support self-awareness and identity.
          Taha wairua provides a sense of meaning and purpose as well as
          experiencing a sense of connectedness to self, whānau, community,
          nature and the sacred.
        </p>
        <ul>
          My plan to keep strong Taha Wairua is to:
          <li>connect with my faith community,</li>
          <li>help others,</li>
          <li>spend time in nature,</li>
          <li>speak with a chaplain or someone you trust.</li>
          <li>
            practice gratitude by regularly acknowledging and appreciating the
            blessings, experiences, and people in my life.
          </li>
          <li>
            spend an hour every week for self-reflection and introspection.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="justify"><li>Taha Whānau (family wellbeing)</li></h2>
        <p>
          Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you care
          about and who you share your life with.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whānau is about extended relationships. It's not just your immediate
          relatives, it's your friends, hoamahi (colleagues), community and the
          people you care about. Everyone has a place and a role to fulfil
          within their whānau, and whānau contributes to your individual
          wellbeing and identity.
        </p>
        <ul>
          I have a daughter who is living and working in Auckland, my parents
          and other relations are living in China. My plan to maitain strong
          Taha Whānau (family wellbeing) is:
          <li>spending time with my daughter every week,</li>
          <li>visiting my parents and other relations every year,</li>
          <li>keeping contact with good friends,</li>
          <li>Showing gratitude.</li>
