          <li>My long term goal or career pathway</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a programmer and web developer, I have two long-term goals and
          career pathways:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>1. Full-stack Developer: </span>I want to become proficient in
          both front-end development (client-side) and back-end development
          (server-side), allowing me to handle all aspects of web development.
          This requires me to have a well-rounded skill set to create complete
          web applications. This would involve mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          and various front-end frameworks and libraries. This could involve
          learning languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP, as well as
          frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring, or Laravel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2. DevOps Engineer: </span>I'm interested in automation,
          deployment, and infrastructure management, I'm also considering a
          career as a DevOps engineer. This role involves managing the
          development and deployment pipelines, configuring servers, and
          ensuring the smooth operation of software applications.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>What is my strengths that will be in Bootcamp?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>My strengths when it comes to Bootcamp include:</p>

        <p>
          1. my emotional intelligence and mindful listening skill can lead me
          to better understand and relate myself to other team members and
          facilitators.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Understanding neuroplasticity and cultivating a growth mindset
          enable me embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and
          continually learn and improve our programming skills.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>What is my limitations that will be in Bootcamp?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          My limitations when it comes to Bootcap is an inability to stay
          focused on a task for a long period of time. However, this limitation
          can be addressed. I can break a big task into smaller chunks, then
          keep focus to solve one chcunk one time and then take break to kepp my
          brain refreshed.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>
            What do I think my biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
            be?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think the biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be time
          management. As I've been advised we need to handle multiple challenges
          every day during Bootcamp. If I are blocked too long by one issue,
          then the following tasks can be affected. To avoid this kind of
          situations, I will use my problem-solving skill to seek assistance.
          Instead of viewing asking for help as a failure, consider it as an
          opportunity to collaborate and learn from others.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would I like to see
            developed in myself while at Dev Academy?
          </li>
        </h2>
        While technical skills are important for success, developing
        non-technical, or human skills, can greatly enhance my overall growth
        and effectiveness as a developer. Following are three non-technical
        skills that I mostly want to consider developing during my time at Dev
        Academy:
        <p>
          <span>1. Communication Skills: </span>Effective communication is
          crucial in a collaborative and team-based environment. Work on
          improving your written and verbal communication skills, as well as my
          ability to actively listen and understand others.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2. Emotional Intelligence: </span>Emotional intelligence
          involves understanding and managing my own emotions and those of
          others. It includes self-awareness, empathy, and the ability to handle
          stress and interpersonal relationships effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3. Leadership and Mentorship: </span>Develop leadership skills
          by taking initiative, inspiring others, and guiding the team towards
          success. Additionally, consider the opportunity to mentor and support
          fellow students, as teaching others can deepen my own understanding.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>What are my expectations from the Bootcamp team?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          As a participant in the Bootcamp, I have certain expectations from the
          Bootcamp team. Here are some expectations in the top priority:

          materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2. Guidance and Support: </span>The bootcamp team should offer
          guidance and support throughout the program. This can involve
          clarifying concepts, answering questions, providing feedback on
          assignments and projects, and offering assistance when I encounter
          difficulties.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3. Practical Projects and Real-World Experience: </span>A good

          practical projects and real-world experience. This can involve working
          on industry-relevant projects, participating in coding challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>4. Community and Networking Opportunities: </span>Bootcamps
          often have a strong sense of community. I can expect the Bootcamp team
          to foster networking opportunities, such as meetups, workshops, or
          alumni events, to connect me with peers, instructors, and
          professionals in the industry.
        </p>
        <h2>
          <li>What are my expectations of myself on Bootcamp</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          Of course, I have certain expectations of myself to make the most out
          of the experience and maximize my learning and growth. Here are some
          most important expectations:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>1. Time Management: </span>I will create a schedule and allocate
          dedicated time for my Bootcamp studies. I will prioritize tasks, set
          realistic goals, and manage my time efficiently to ensure I meet
          deadlines and make progress in the curriculum.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>2. Active Collaboration: </span>I will actively collaborate with
          my fellow learners, facilitators. I will actively listen to others'
          ideas, provide constructive feedback, and be open to incorporating
          different viewpoints into my work. I will contribute to group
          projects, actively participate in discussions, and support my peers to
          create a collaborative and enriching learning experience for all.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>3. Respect and Empathy: </span>I will treat all individuals
          involved in the Bootcamp program with respect, empathy, and
          professionalism. I will value diverse perspectives and foster an
          inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable
          expressing their thoughts and ideas.

          work, such as breaking tasks into smaller chunks to remain focused,
          taking regular breaks, and setting aside time each day to research new
          industry trends.
