              <h2><li>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</li></h2>
                <p>My long-term goal or career pathway is continuing to develop my technical proficiency and staying up to date with the latest trends in web development software. This could involve furthering my education in web development, exploring additional coding languages, and becoming full stack web developer. Additionally, I could focus on honing my interpersonal skills, building a professional network.</p>

              <h2><li>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</li></h2>
                <p>My strengths when it comes to learning include my attention to detail, my willingness to explore new resources and technologies, my ability to connect with others and build relationships, and my open and curious attitude when it comes to learning. Additionally, my previous experience and technical proficiency in web app and web API development areas can be a great asset while learning.
</p>
<p>
                My limitations when it comes to learning may include a lack of experience or knowledge in certain technologies, an inability to stay focused on a task for a long period of time, and difficulty in staying up to date with the latest trends in web development software. However, these limitations can be addressed with practice and hard work, such as breaking tasks into smaller chunks to remain focused, taking regular breaks, and setting aside time each day to research new industry trends.</p>

               <h2><li>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li></h2>        
                 <p>Some non-technical core/human skills I would like to see developed in myself at Dev Academy include strong interpersonal skills, problem-solving capabilities, time management, and communication skills. Through this program, I would also like to gain a better understanding of the importance of collaboration and teamwork. Additionally, I would like to develop the ability to ask questions for clarification. All of this would help me develop my career.</p>
                 <h2><li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</li></h2>
                <p>I commit to managing my workload in this program by breaking tasks into smaller parts and focusing on one task at a time. I will also stay organized by managing my time effectively through the Toggl App. I also commit to taking regular breaks and scheduling some downtime in order to stay motivated and productive. Finally, I will reach out for help whenever I am feeling stuck or overwhelmed so that I can stay on track and make the most out of each learning opportunity.</p>

                <h2><li>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</li></h2>
                <p>I expect the facilitation team to provide me with guidance and support throughout my learning journey.
                    Additionally, I believe they should equip me with the necessary tools and strategies for successfully executing tasks.
                    Finally, I would appreciate if they could keep giving me honest feedback on my work, and provide an encouraging and collaborative learning environment
                  </p>
                <h2><li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</li></h2>  
                <p>I am committed to dedicating 40-60 hours a week to this program. I am generally available Monday through Friday from 9:00am to 12:00pm, from 2:00pm to 5:30pm, and from 7:00pm to 10:00pm. Additionally, I have committed to put in a few hours every Saturday and Sunday for extra work on this program.</p>
