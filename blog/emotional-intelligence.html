        <p>
          Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand, use, and manage
          your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate
          effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse
          conflict. EQ helps you build stronger relationships, succeed at school
          and work, and achieve your career and personal goals. It can also help
          you to connect with your feelings, turn intention into action, and
          make informed decisions about what matters most to you.

        <h2 class="justify">How do we Cultivate Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotional Intelligence is not something you are born with. It is
          something that we learn. What we think, do, and pay attention to
          changes the structure and function of our brains. In the same way that
          we train the muscles in our body, we can train and change our brain.
          As with any skill, we can train our Emotional Intelligence skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can cultivate emotional intelligence by practicing mindfulness,
          taking time to reflect on our emotions, being self-aware, developing
          empathy, recognizing and managing triggers, practicing active
          listening, and engaging in open and honest conversations. We can also
          cultivate emotional intelligence through self-improvement activities
          such as journaling, reading books, taking classes and attending
          seminars, and engaging in activities that foster self-care. Being
          aware of our moments of emotional intensity and developing
          self-management skills can also help us cultivate emotional
          intelligence. /p>
