        <h2><li>I Was Blocked On a Simple Problem</li></h2>
        <p>
          Writing code can sometimes be like solving puzzles, and this particular puzzle had me stumped for quite some time. Once upon a time, I encountered a problem while working on a web api project.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was knee-deep in code, trying to make the function work on the project I was developing. Everything seemed to be going smoothly but the function didn't return the right result. It was a seemingly simple problem, yet it had me scratching my head in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling stuck and unable to find a way forward, I recalled a technique that has helped me a few times before: the rubber duck method. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The rubber duck method is a problem-solving technique used by many developers. The idea is simple: when you encounter a roadblock, you explain the problem step by step to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck. By describing the issue out loud, you often gain a fresh perspective and can identify the root cause of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my case, I grabbed my trusty rubber duck from my desk and began explaining the function's logic to it. I meticulously went through line by line of the code, explaining what I expected to happen and what was actually happening. As I spoke, something amazing occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
           suddenly, the answer dawned on me. It turned out that I had made a simple mistake in the logic of my code. In one line, I wnated to get the remainder of input devided by 5, but the line return the integer part of the input devided by 5. This error was causing the function to return wrong results. After I corrected this error, the function began to work properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this example, I've learned thet problem-solving is not always about having the most advanced tools. It's often about finding creative ways to approach obstacles, even if it means talking to a rubber duck.
        </p>

        <p>
          A few years ago, I was asked to develope an application that could analyze vast amounts of data to generate valuable insights. At first, I felt the job seemed overwhelmingly complex, but after I'd read analised the requirement specifications, I found that breaking it down into smaller components would make it more manageable. I asked myself a few questions like, "What are the individual tasks that need to be performed?" and "What are the core functionalities required for the software?"
        </p>
        <p>
          By answering these questions, I was able to identify the smaller components required for the application, which were Data Input, Result Visualization, Data Service, Data Analysis, and Data Access.
        </p>
        <ul>
          The basic architecture is: 
          <li>
            <span>Data Input Component</span> would be used to collect data. It would provided a user interface for users to input data.
          </li>
            <li>
              <span>Data Visualisation Component</span> would be used to display the analised results to users in different formats such as table format, bar chat etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Data Analysis Component</span> would implement the algorithms to analyze the data supplied by the Data Service Component, and supplied the analised result to the Data Visualisation Component to display to the users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Data Service Component</span> would validat the data collected from the Data Input Component, and then sent the validated data the Data Access Component which would save the data to the database. Also Data Service Component would request data from Data Access, then supplie the requested to Data Analysis Component.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>Data Access Component</span> would save the data from Data Service Component to the database and retrived data from the database and supplied the data to Data Service Component. 
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          With a clear plan in mind, I implemented and tested the components one by one and then integrated them together and test again, I created a comprehensive software application taht could analyse the data, generate insights, and present the results in a user-friendly manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of breaking down the complex task into smaller components made the overall development process much more approachable and less overwhelming. It not only made the task easier to solve but also enhanced the overall quality of the software by ensuring that each individual component was well-designed and thoroughly tested.

        </h2>
          <p>
            <span>Pseudocode:</span>
            Pseudocode is a high-level representation of a solution that doesn't require any specific programming language syntax. It helps in planning and organizing my thoughts before writing actual code.
            I use this method nearly on every application, module, component, procedure, and function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Trying something:</span>
            This approach involves experimenting with different ideas or solutions to a problem. It's about being willing to try various approaches, even if you're unsure if they'll work. I like to try something when I get a chance.
          </p>
          p>
            <span>Rubber ducky method:</span>
            The rubber ducky method involves explaining your problem or code to an inanimate object (like a rubber ducky) or another person. It helps to identify issues or errors by verbalizing your thoughts. I use this method when I am blocked and can't the clue to the problem.
          </p>
            <span>Reading error messages:</span>
            Error messages provide valuable information about issues in our code. Being able to understand and interpret these messages is crucial for effective problem-solving. 
          <p>
            <span>Console.log:</span>
            The console.log function allows us to output messages or variables to the console for debugging purposes. It is a very helpful tool for understanding program flow and identifying issues. I use it often.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Googling:</span>
            Googling is a common practice for developers to find information or solutions to problems they encounter.
            I think I use this method most often.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Asking your peers for help:</span>
            Reaching out to my peers or colleagues for assistance can be a valuable resource for problem-solving. Particully, when I work on a group project, it can be very effective to ask help from group mates.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span>Asking coaches for help:</span>
            Coaches can provide expert guidance and support. When I feel the question is not clear, I would like to ask the coaches. When I was blocked by a problem for some time, I would like to as the coaches.
          </p>
          <p>
          <span>Improving your process with reflection:</span>
            Reflection is the act of looking back at your problem-solving process, evaluating its effectiveness, and making improvements for future problem-solving. I practiced this method nearly on every project I did.
          </p>
          
          <h2>
            <li>
            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
          </li>
            
          </h2>
          <p>
            Quite a few years ago, I was working on a project, and I was blocked by a problem.
            At that time, I had a strong desire to solve problems on my own, so I was reluctant to ask for help. But it took me too much time to get the solution, and resulted in a panic to finish the job.
          </p>
            <p>
              It could be a positive trait to solve the problem by myself. However, It was crucial to recognize when seeking assistance could save my time and provided alternative perspectives.
          </p>
          <p>
             After that time, I changed my consideration on asking for help. Instead of viewing asking for help as a failure, consider it as an opportunity to collaborate and learn from others. Embrace the chance to expand my knowledge and develop new problem-solving strategies.
