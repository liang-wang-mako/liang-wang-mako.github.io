            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The three new things I have learnt about myself and my ego due to the
          core learning are:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Awareness of self-limiting beliefs: </span>At the beginning of
          the course, I found I needed to write two or three blogs, and provide
          reflections on lot of questions every week. I was really worry about
          that as I thought I was not good at English writing and I didn't like
          to write in English. Through emotional intelligence exploration, I
          became aware of the emotions associated with self-limiting beliefs.
          Negative emotions like fear, self-doubt, or dislike often accompany
          these beliefs. I suddenly understood the reasons I was not good at
          writing in English were my belief itself and the emotion that I didn't
          like to write in English.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span>Recognition of the potential for change: </span>Through Learning
          about neuroplasticity, I understood my brain had remarkable capacity
          to adapt and change. This understanding has led me to realize that my
          ego and its associated beliefs are not fixed or unchangeable. I have
          discovered that I have the ability to rewire my thinking patterns,
          challenge limiting beliefs, and develop new perspectives. This
          recognition opens up a world of possibilities for personal growth and
          transformation. My improvement in English writing is just an example.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Shifting perspective on failure and challenges: </span>A growth
          mindset means viewing setbacks, failures, and challenges as
          opportunities for learning and growth. Through the core learning
          process, I have begun to developed a new perspective on these
          experiences. Rather than seeing them as personal flaws or reasons for
          self-criticism, I have learned to approach them with curiosity,
          resilience, and a desire to learn. This shift in perspective can lead
          to increased self-compassion and a willingness to step outside my
          comfort zone, ultimately fostering personal growth and development. I
          am feeling I like to write in English.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          <span>Values: </span>Values are the guiding principles and beliefs
          that shape our behavior and decision-making. In learning, values help
          me prioritize what knowledge and skills are important to acquire, and
          remind me team's sucess is more important the individual success. In
          programming, values guide ethical decision-making, such as respecting
          user privacy, ensuring data security, and developing inclusive and
          accessible software.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Empathy: </span>Empathy is the ability to understand and share
          the feelings and perspectives of others. In learning, empathy helps me
          understand others' challenges and needs, engage in collaborative
          learning, and build supportive relationships. In programming, empathy
          helps me design and develop software that meets the needs of users
          effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Self-awareness: </span>Self-awareness is the ability to
          introspect and understand one's own thoughts, emotions, and behaviors.
          In learning, self-awareness helps me understand my learning style,
          strengths, weaknesses, and preferences. In programming, self-awareness
          helps me to identify my biases, assumptions, and limitations.

        <h2>
          <li>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          What has surprised me the most about the core learning is that
          Cultivating emotional intelligence, understanding and practicing
          neuroplasticity, and developing a growth mindset can be incredibly
          powerful in personal development and achieving goals.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>W hat were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging aspects of the core learning is to write a blog
          after learning a topic. We only spent a quite short learning time on
          each topic. However, to write a blog, we need to not only study the
          material in the course book, but also search for additional
          information relating to the topic online. Then we organize material to
          write the blog. So, the time is alway critical for me. But this way
          has developed my abilities to problem-solving and time management.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>
          I think following reasons can explain why our school are spending so
          much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
          course:
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, core skills is about growing the human part of the web
          development equation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, understanding ourself in the context of others and utilising
          our Human Skills will set us up for our career. Tech employers aren't
          looking for top grades or the person with the most outstanding code.
          They're looking for exceptional human beings who will enhance the
          culture of their team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, hiring managers agree that training a person to do the
          job is relatively easy, but teaching them how to communicate,
          cooperate, and work amongst diverse perspectives is much more complex.
          That's where Core and Human Skills come in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, core will introduce us to techniques to train our mind. We'll
          learn valuable ways of understanding problems and support to
          strengthen our self-solving skills. Core also prepares us for learning
          experiences drawing from our agency of values and strengths. It is the
          culmination of values, awareness, and mindset to maximise our learning
          and career journey.
        </p>

        <h2>
          <li>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </li>
        </h2>
        <p>So far, in our core learning process, we have learned:</p>
        <li>identity, values, and strengths,</li>
        <li>learning plan,</li>
        <li>emotional intelligence,</li>
        <li>neuroplasticity</li>
        <li>a growth mindset</li>
        <p>
          Studying core learning can be incredibly valuable and complementary to
          practicing programming. Here are a few justifications for dedicating
          time to studying core learning:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Self-awareness and personal growth: </span>Core learning helps
          us explore and understand our identity, values, and strengths. This
          self-reflection is crucial in guiding our career choices, setting
          meaningful goals, and aligning our actions with your values. By
          gaining clarity on our personal attributes and motivations, we can
          make informed decisions about the programming path that best suits our
          interests and goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Learning efficiency and effectiveness: </span>Making a learning
          plan helps us structure our learning journey, set achievable goals,
          identify the resources and steps needed to progress, optimize our
          learning process, track our progress, and stay focused on acquiring
          the relevant programming skills aligned with our goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills: </span
          >Cultivating emotional intelligence enhances our ability to understand
          and manage emotions, both in ourselves and in others. This skill is
          valuable in any professional setting, including programming. Emotional
          intelligence enables effective communication, collaboration, and
          problem-solving. By cultivating emotional intelligence, we can build
          strong relationships, foster a positive work environment, and enhance
          our overall professional effectiveness as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span>Mental resilience and growth mindset: </span>Understanding
          neuroplasticity and cultivating a growth mindset are powerful tools
          for personal and professional development. They allow us to embrace
          challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, and continually learn and
          improve our programming skills. By adopting a growth mindset, we view
          obstacles as opportunities for growth, approach learning with
          enthusiasm, and maintain resilience in the face of programming
          challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, by dedicating time to core learning alongside
          programming practice, we can develop a well-rounded skill set that
          goes beyond technical proficiency. These aspects contribute to our
          personal and professional growth, enhance our problem-solving
          abilities, and foster effective collaboration and communication.
          Ultimately, this comprehensive approach can lead to long-term success
          and satisfaction in our programming career.
